# Advent of Code 2021 :christmas_tree:

It's been a while since I used Python, so I'll use [AoC 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021) as a refresher.

I tried to make the code as clean and easy to read as possible, and I've also provided a short explanation to most
solutions so that they're easier to understand.

## Structure

### Solutions

The corresponding files for each solution are grouped within a dayXX folder. Each package contains:

- solution.py: my implementation of the solution to the puzzle
- test_solution.py: the test containing the result, confirming the algorithm works
- puzzle.txt: a dump of the puzzle text from the website, with the source link at the top
- input.txt: the puzzle input I received

## Running

1. Open this project in [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
2. Open the solution or test you want to run.
3. Right click it and press _Run 'solution'_.
